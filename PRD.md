Since you're building this to land an **SDE II** role at a mid-to-large product company, your landing page needs to shift from "cool hobby project" to "engineered solution." Recruiters at that level look for scalability, system thinking, and a focus on user experience.

Here is a breakdown of what your prototype landing page should feature to make it "resume-ready."

---

## 1. The "Above the Fold" Hero Section

Don’t just say "AI Interviewer." Be specific about the problem you are solving.

- **Headline:** "Master System Design Interviews with Real-Time AI Feedback."
- **Sub-headline:** "Practice high-level architecture, database sharding, and load balancing scenarios with an LLM-powered mentor that understands trade-offs."
- **Primary CTA:** "Start a Mock Session" or "View Demo Architecture."

## 2. Interactive "System Snapshot"

Since the project is about **System Design**, show that the AI actually understands diagrams or flowcharts.

- **Feature:** A mini-window showing a sample conversation where a user suggests "Redis for caching" and the AI responds with a nuanced follow-up about **Cache Eviction Policies** or **Cache Aside patterns**.
- **Why:** This proves your app isn't just a basic wrapper, but a tool designed for senior-level engineering concepts.

## 3. The "Engineered Features" Grid

Instead of listing "Chat" or "Login," list features that highlight your technical depth:

- **Real-time Latency Estimation:** Does the AI calculate potential bottlenecks?
- **Architecture Scoring:** A breakdown of the user's design based on Scalability, Availability, and Reliability.
- **Diagram Integration:** Mention if users can "draw" or describe components that the AI then parses.

## 4. The "Under the Hood" Section (Crucial for SDE II)

This is the most important part for your resume. Include a **high-level architecture diagram** of the app itself on the landing page.

- **Tech Stack Tags:** Next.js, FastAPI/Node.js, Pinecone (for RDB/Vector search), LangChain, and AWS/GCP icons.
- **Design Trade-offs:** A 2-3 sentence blurb on why you chose a specific database or how you handled LLM token streaming to keep UI latency low.

## 5. Social Proof / Metrics (Simulated)

Even if it's a prototype, show you care about data:

- "50+ Common System Design Scenarios (Uber, WhatsApp, TinyURL)."
- "Average feedback latency < 200ms."

### A "Pro" Tip for your Resume

Since you are targeting a **12 LPA+** role, ensure the landing page is **responsive**. If a hiring manager opens it on their phone and the layout breaks, it sends the wrong signal about your attention to "Production Grade" quality.

**Would you like me to help you draft the "System Design of the App" diagram or explain how to handle the state management for the chat interface?**
